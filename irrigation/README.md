# Sprinkler Irrigation System
## General Description
The programme controls the sprinkler watering system of a residential garden.
## Components
The system consists, mainly, of a water pump and 2 electrovalves (EVs). The pump pressurizes water in the pipe line
so that the sprinklers have enough pressure to rise up and work properly. Each EV is associated to a different garden sector, therefore, 
they work as a gate.
## Programme
The code, basically, commands the activation and shut-down of the components. It is divided into two sections:  
1. Automatic sequence: allows the user to choose the duration, time of the day, days of the week when the watering will occur. There is
a section for each season of the year (summer,autumn,winter,spring).
2. Manual activation: allows the user to activate the system anytime. Default is 15min per sector with a 30min halt inbetween.
## Extras
Also, the system includes two protections: an emergency break button and a water level sensor.
